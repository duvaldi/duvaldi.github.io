											<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
										</header>
										<header> 
							<h3>What is my interest in IT? </h3>
						</header>
							<p>It is such a rapid evolving field and industry, which keeps it super exciting. 
							I love gadgets and newer technology that works better and faster than anything
							from yesterday, which allows us to achieve so much more.
							</P>
						<header>
							<h3>When did my interest in IT start? </h3>
						</header>
							<p>My earliest memories of interests in IT was by dissembling any electronic device
								I could lay my hands on and being fascinated by the looks of capacitors, 
								resistors etc on the circuit boards. This was probably around the ages 
								of 5-7. I also remember how much fun it was using command line
								(because that’s all there was at that stage) to access games and install 
								programs after building a computer from scratch.
							</p>
						<header>
							<h3>Was there a particular event or person that sparked my interest? </h>
						</header>	
							<p>The person in my life that definitely played a big roll in my interest in IT
								would have been my dad. He use to own a computer shop and I played there 
								A LOT while growing up. 
							</p>
						<header>
							<h3>My IT experience outline .</h3>
							<p>I have limited IT experience at this stage. I used to build computers as a kid 
								and then worked in IT for about 6 months after completing my 
								A+ and N+ certificates.
							</p>
						<header>
							<h3>Why did I choose to come to RMIT? </h3>
							<p>I chose RMIT because I liked how they have real world connections with the
								industry and seems really focused on teaching information that are relevant
								to everyday knowledge that one would use in a real job. 
								The university is also in a great 
								location! 
							</p>
						<header>
							<h3>What do I expect to learn during my studies? </h3>
						</header>	
							<p>The short answer to what I hope to learn during my studies would be 
								AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE! But I’m hoping to learn how to be a good programmer 
								and want to learn about as many different avenues in IT to see
								what else sparks an interest. I would also like to see what other useful skills I can 
								pick up to be a better candidate for jobs that I’m going to apply for.

									<h2>My ideal job</h2>
								</header>
								<ul class="features">
									<li>
										<span class="icon solid major style1 fa-code"></span>
										<h3>Job description and appeal </h3>
										<p>The position I would like to apply for requires coding for the platform that OpenAI uses for their 
											robots to learn new behaviours through machine learning. This position sounds appealing because it has to do 
											with programming, robots and AI, which are all very exciting. In addition, the job also has great perks.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<span class="icon major style3 fa-copy"></span>
										<h3>Skills I would require</h3>
										<p>I will need a lot of programming experience for this job, particularly in Python and C++. I will also need to be proficient 
											in using a UNIX operating system. Therefore, I will need good programming skills and take programming units, 
											and perhaps complete a BA in Computer Science. It would also help to get an internship at a similar company to gain 
											experience in programming, robotics, and real-time control systems.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<span class="icon major style5 fa-gem"></span>
										<h3>Current skills</h3>
										<p>I currently hold a very different set of skills, qualifications and experience to what I would need to do that job. 
											All my skills, qualifications and experience are in the hospitality industry. Nevertheless, I have held many managing roles and I have dealt with a lot of staff, suppliers and customers.
											I also have business experience, by running my own for 5 years.</p>

										<li><a href="http://www.humanmetrics.com/personality/intj" class="button">Myer-Briggs result :</a></li>
									</ul>
									<h3><b>INTJ</b></h3>
									<p><b>What do the results of these tests mean for you? </b></br>

										My results for the Myer-Briggs test shows that my personality is the INTJ type, which stands 
										for Introverted iNtuitive Thinking Judging. Even though I can somewhat relate to a few of the traits 
										(i.e. innovative, independent, value knowledge and have high standards for performance), there are also some I 
										do not relate with. Overall, I am struggling to believe that by filling out around a 100 close-ended questionnaire
										can put you into 1 of 16 boxes. In addition, I am finding it very difficult to find any concrete scientific evidence that 
										the Myer-Briggs test has any value.  
								</P>





								<p><b>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team? </b></br>

								I think I am fairly competent working in most team setups where the team members value taking the task at hand serious and value hard work. 
								It is challenging for me to work with team members with a “don’t care" attitude.  
						</p>
		<p><b>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</b></br>


							I should make sure that the team members have good work ethic, want to achieve good results and do not want to waste time. 
							In addition it would be great to have team members that I get along with and possibly have some sort of a common 
								interest with.
<br />

								<ul class="actions special">
										<li><a href="https://www.how-to-study.com/study-skills-articles/tactile-kinesthetic-learner.asp" class="button">Learning Style test result :</a></li>
									</ul>
									<h3><b>Tactile/Kinesthetic Learner</b></h3>
									<p><b>What do the results of these tests mean for you? </b></br>

										It is showing that I am a tactile learner. I find this to be very true as I learn a lot better when I can physically
										do something myself. It means that I need to be more active while studying and do things myself to comprehend it rather than 
										passive reading.  
								</P>





								<p><b>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team? </b></br>

								Depending on other learning styles in the group it would only mean I might have to do things slightly different 
								or be the one that physicality does some task to better understand.
						</p>
								<p><b>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</b></br>


							I don’t think my learning style alone would affect anything too much when forming a team. It has more to do with what I value when 
							it comes to working and getting things done.
<br />

										<li><a href="https://www.123test.com/report/DKEDBJ69S88I105PHT/free/" class="button">Big 5 personality result :</a></li>
									</ul>
									<h3><b></b></h3>
									<p><b>What do the results of these tests mean for you? </b></br>

										It is showing that I prefer technical problem solving, have good work ethic, prefer co-operation over conflict, that I am
										good natured and have fairly neutral reactions. I am interpreting my results, for working in a team and leadership being in 
										the middle range, to be on a case-to-case basis. For some things I see the value of a team and for other tasks I can see that 
										working on my own could be more beneficial. As far as leadership goes, I have been on both sides of the fence, I’ve been the leader 
										but I’m also happy to follow a strong leader and have enjoyed both sides.
								</P>





								<p><b>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team? </b></br>

								It would make me a good team member having good work ethic as I prefer cooperation to achieve good results. I tend not to waste time 
								in trying to compete with team members but rather working towards a common goal.  
						</p>
		<p><b>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</b></br>


							Find team members that value time management and that do not prefer conflict and competition. Even though it shows I am on the traditionalist, 
							down to earth and practical side (and that is true), I am still definitely imaginative, open-minded and experimental. Thus, I might fit in a diverse team.
