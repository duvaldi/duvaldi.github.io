<<<<<<< HEAD
A dark, slick, modern, responsive, adjective-drenched design built around an extremely
dynamic landing page (scroll that mofo!). Inspired by Big Picture, another design
of mine with a similarish feel/flow, only this time I took it waaaaaay further and
actually made it multipurpose (versus copping out and making it a one pager like I
did last time ;) Includes multiple pages, a bunch of pre-styled elements, and all
its Sass sources.
=======
This is Massively, a text-heavy, article-oriented design built around a huge background
image (with a new parallax implementation I'm testing) and scroll effects (powered by
Scrollex). A *slight* departure from all the one-pagers I've been doing lately, but one
that fulfills a few user requests and makes use of some new techniques I've been wanting
to try out. Enjoy it :)
