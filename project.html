								<h2>Overview</h2>
								<p>It is a common problem of having items in your fridge or freezer that are left over from either over
									purchasing or a previous dish, and then never used again. As a result, the energy
									that was used to grow or produce the item, transport it, and 
									refrigerate it was ultimately wasted until it went into the trash. The same goes for unused, expired items in your pantry. 
The idea for this project is to create a smart fridge and a smart pantry combination that will form a smart kitchen. The goal is to have an “assistant” in your house that can help you to better eliminate food waste. It can also assist you with meal planning and give you recipes or ideas what to cook. The overarchign goal is to eliminate food wastage because it is better for the environment and your pocket.
   </p>
								<h2>Motivation</h2>
								<p> This project will be interesting because I have feel very strongly against wasting food. It is absurd that we spend so much money and energy into producing food and then just letting it go to waste. Not only is this a waste of time and money, but it also negatively impacts our environment.  It is estimated that households in Australia alone throw away AU$5.2 billion worth of food each year (Reynolds et al. 2014). These human actions lead to unnnecessary consumption of freshwater and fossil fuels, which, along with methane and CO2 emissions from decomposing food, contributes significantly to global climate change 
(Hall et al. 2009).

A lot of this food wasting comes from mismanaging and a lack of knowledge of what to cook out of random ingredients at home. To be able to reduce that wastage and educate people would be good for the environment and for every household.
</p>
								
								<h2>Description</h2>
								<p>The plan is that the system could hold your current inventory of fresh ingredients, frozen items and dry goods items like spices, flour, sugar, coffee, canned items etc. A screen on the fridge (like many current smart fridges) would display all recipes, inventory, shopping lists etc. and an app on your phone would allow you to see what’s on hand when you are on the go. The system in your house would also work with voice commands. 
It would give you reminders to use and consume leftovers before they go over a certain amount of days after you cooked it (or take away from restaurant), so that the food does not go to waste. 
It will also display suggested recipes made with food that is on hand before expiring and hold a wide range of recipes that if selected will then form a shopping list of ingredients you would need to make that recipe and showing possibilities of substitutes of items already on hand.  
Inventory would be able to be uploaded by the consumer (i.e. when fresh produce or other items were bought at a farmers market or anywhere where items don’t have barcodes or receipts are given), by supermarket receipt name and quantity or by scanning the barcode before you put it in the fridge or pantry. 
Using your inventory could happen through voice commands as you are cooking or using items to let the system know what you are using and how much. The system could also give the user commands through voice while a recipe is getting executed.
Based on your taste and dietary needs that have been selected it would provide you with a suggested meal planner for the week. The meal planner would be formed, based on items that are in season in your specific location (to help reduce your environmental impact). Items in season also taste better and have better prices.
There would also be a function to compare your grocery list to check where the best overall prices could be found.
Another function is a nutritional component that can give you a better indication of how healthy the dish or item is that you eat. Warning signs can appear for certain items (i.e. sugar) and it could keep track of your calorie intake and compare that with your health app data on your phone or watch.
  </p>
							<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>	
								<p> This project has a few different components that would each require a few different software and hardware pieces. For the smart fridge component: there are already smart fridges out there that have screens on them and that can hold recipes. It might be an option to utilise that existing technology to suit the needs laid out above.
The smart pantry component would be based in the smart fridge as an app that functions through the screen and voice commands of the fridge. 
The voice command component could be Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant.
The app on your phone would be a standard phone application.
A fridge camera and scanner would also be necessary to scan items as they go into the fridge.
The system as a whole would have to be able to connect over wifi so that it can get information about your health data and search for recipes and prices.
A lot of the project would be app development (for the fridge and for a phone based app).
</p>	
								
							<h2>Skills Required</h2>	
								<p> The main skills required for this project would be programming and app developing and engineering skills for the apps it would need to run. Some database knowledge would be needed as it would also need a database that holds all the ingredients and combinations of ingredients to provide suggestions of items that can be used together. Seeing that the hardware needed for this project does already exist and it would mainly need different apps and voice command to interact, I would say it could be a very feasible option to create this idea. </p>	
								
							<h2>Outcome</h2>
								<p>If this project has a successful outcome and does get produced into a working system it would greatly improve the food waste problem if it were used correctly. I think it has the potential to hugely change the way we shop, cook and manage our household kitchens and in the process reduce climate change. We would let technology help us where we lack knowledge or where we are just too lazy to go the extra mile to look for recipes and ideas to check how we can use up ingredients.   </p>
